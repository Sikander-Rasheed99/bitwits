export const FaqsList = [
    {
        title: "What is cross-platform app development?",
        txt: "Cross-platform app development allows building apps for both iOS and Android using a single codebase. It’s an efficient method for reaching a broader audience without duplicating efforts. With technologies like Flutter or React Native, these apps run smoothly across devices, delivering consistent performance on both platforms."
    },
    {
        title: "What technologies are used in cross-platform app development?",
        txt: "Flutter and React Native are widely considered the top choices for cross-platform mobile app development. Flutter excels in delivering a uniform UI experience, while React Native is preferred for its flexibility and JavaScript base. The decision depends on whether you prioritize design consistency or access to native features."
    },
    {
        title: "What are the advantages of cross-platform app development?",
        txt: "Cross-platform app development services reduce development time and cut costs significantly. With one codebase, you eliminate the need for separate teams or updates for iOS and Android. This also simplifies app maintenance, making it easier to keep the app up-to-date across all platforms without added complexity."
    },
    {
        title: "How much cost savings can you do with cross-platform app development?",
        txt: "Cross-platform mobile app development reduces the need for separate iOS and Android teams, cutting down on the overall cost. Maintenance is also simplified, as updates only require one round of development. This efficient approach makes it a popular choice for businesses looking to get the most out of their budget."
    },
    {
        title: "Are there any limitations with cross-platform app development?",
        txt: "Cross-platform app development has limitations when dealing with hardware or platform-specific features, but these don’t affect most early-stage apps. For typical business needs, cross-platform development provides strong performance and functionality without requiring the expense of native app development."
    },
    {
        title: "Can cross-platform apps offer native-like performance?",
        txt: "Yes, cross-platform apps can match native app performance in most cases. Technologies like Flutter and React Native are optimized for speed and responsiveness, allowing cross-platform app development companies to build apps that run efficiently across platforms without lagging behind native apps in terms of quality."
    },
    {
        title: "How long does it take to develop a cross-platform app?",
        txt: "Development timelines depend on the complexity of the app. Simple cross-platform apps can be completed within 3-6 months, while more feature-rich ones might take up to a year. Cross-platform application development services typically speed things up, as work is done for both iOS and Android at once."
    },
    {
        title: "How do I choose between cross-platform and native development?",
        txt: "If your app demands complex, platform-specific features, native development may be a better choice. However, for most apps, cross-platform app development services offer a quicker, more cost-efficient way to deliver a great user experience across both iOS and Android without the overhead of separate projects."
